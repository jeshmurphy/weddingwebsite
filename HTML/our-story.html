                                 <p class="text-center margin-bottom-30 our-story-el">Jes and Joe met during the fall semester at Montclair State University. She would often invite him out for coffee after class, but he always declined. They went about their lives not really thinking of the other.</p>

                                <p class="text-center margin-bottom-30 our-story-el">Early in the spring semester Joe decided to finally go out for coffee. At this point Jes had moved on and was busy with other interests, but she agreed anyway. They spent 10 hours talking at a local diner, Joe was making up for all the declined coffee dates. He was smitten. She was oblivious.<p/> 
                                <p class="text-center margin-bottom-30 our-story-el">Over the next couple of months Joe found a way to see more and more of Jes. He gave her a gift of a book, <i>IQ<i/>, one of their shared favorites.  Joe REALLY won her over when he had a custom cake made in her favorite flavor - key lime.</p>
                                <p class="text-center margin-bottom-30 our-story-el">They made it official April 1st.<p/>

                                <p class="text-center margin-bottom-30 our-story-el">They packed up their belongings and ventured to New York City - despite his allergy to her cat, Neko. It was a rough year for Joe acclimating to Neko and taking ALL the allergy medicine. Neko was not thrilled this human was in Jessie’s life and took all her attention. Eventually the two found a way to coexist.</p>

                                <p class="text-center margin-bottom-30 our-story-el">Lots of new adventures for the pair, filled with amazing food, friends, and family. Jes wanted  to try the juicing fad so Joe bought her a shiny new juicer. Mostly it took up space on the counter and collected dust. Life was good. So good they thought they’d try their hand at entrepreneurship. And so Nullipotent was born, Joe led the way with innovative tech while Jes kept things organized.</p>

                                <p class="text-center margin-bottom-30 our-story-el">Joe and Jes were getting tired of living on the east side of Manhattan and decided to move across town. Jes went apartment hunting alone, and without even seeing the apartment Joe was ready to sign. Anyone who knows Jes knows how horrible she is with spatial reasoning, but Joe showed absolute trust in his partner in crime. Somehow they made their tiny home work.</p>
                                <p class="text-center margin-bottom-30 our-story-el">This was the year of their first trip to Disney as a couple. It was a magical trip. They went in November during the Food and Wine Festival.</p>

                                <p class="text-center margin-bottom-30 our-story-el">Jes and Joe spent another year growing and learning together. Both still amazed that even after several years together there was so much more to learn about the other.</p>

                                <p class="text-center margin-bottom-30 our-story-el">At some point while all this had been happening over the last several years, they realized that they wanted it all to keep happening, forever.<p/> 
                                <p class="text-center margin-bottom-30 our-story-el">One hot day in July Jes and Joe were talking and the conversation shifted to marriage. They agreed that a small city hall wedding sometime soon would be a clever idea.</p>
                                <p class="text-center margin-bottom-30 our-story-el">AND then a friend suggested they incorporate their love of Disney. Joe was immediately sold on the idea and in typical Jes fashion she did more than the necessary research and came to the same conclusion. <p/>

We're heading south to Walt Disney World to make it official at the end of March. The party will be small. But never fear we'll be visiting all our loved ones during the rest of the year.</p>
