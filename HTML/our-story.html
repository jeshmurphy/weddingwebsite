                                 <p class="text-center margin-bottom-30 our-story-el">Jes and Joe met during the fall semester at Montclair State University. She would often invite him out for coffee after class, but he always said that he was too busy. They went about their lives not really thinking of the other.</p> 
                            </div>

                                <h2 class="text-center margin-top-10">2011</h2>
                                <p class="text-center margin-bottom-30 our-story-el"> Early in the spring semester, Joe finally decided that he wanted to go out for coffee. Jes had moved on and was busy with other interests, but it had been a long day writing a paper for class without coffee or food. She figured she had to eat anyway. Joe made up for all those declined coffee dates--they spent 10 hours talking at a local diner. He was smitten. She was oblivious.<p/> 
                                <p class="text-center margin-bottom-30 our-story-el">Over the next couple of months, Joe found ways to see more and more of Jes. They discovered that they shared a love of Star Trek: The Next Generation, and he gave her a book, IQ, about their favorite character. They spent more and more time together. Jes thought he was just a friend; he thought she was a sure thing. And Joe managed to win her over when he had a custom birthday cake made in her favorite flavor - key lime.</p>
                                <p class="text-center margin-bottom-30 our-story-el">They made it official April 1st.<p/>

                                <p class="text-center margin-bottom-30 our-story-el">Despite his allergy to her cat, Neko, they decided it was time to move in together. packed up their belongings and ventured to New York City. It was a rough year for Joe, acclimating to Neko and taking every allergy medicine under the sun. Neko was not thrilled, either. There was a new human in Jessie’s life, and he took all of her attention. But eventually the two found a way to coexist. Neko learned he could no longer sleep on the bed all the time. And Joe learned that when you live with a cat you are no longer the boss. </p>

                                <p class="text-center margin-bottom-30 our-story-el">This was a year filled with lots of new adventures for the pair—amazing food, friends, and family. Jes wanted  to try the juicing fad so Joe bought her a shiny new juicer. Mostly it took up space on the counter and collected dust. She was too busy using her kitchen aid stand mixer to make all the baked goods for Joe. Life was good. So good they thought they’d try their hand at entrepreneurship. And so their tech company Nullipotent was born. Joe led the way with innovative tech, while Jes kept the business running on time and in the black.</p>

                                <p class="text-center margin-bottom-30 our-story-el">Joe and Jes were getting tired of living on the east side of Manhattan—a little too sleepy for their standards—and decided to move across town. Jes went apartment hunting alone, and found a charming little studio near Central Park. Without even seeing the apartment, Joe was ready to sign. Anyone who knows Jes knows that spatial reasoning isn’t her strongest suit, but Joe showed absolute trust in his partner in crime. The kitchen is so tiny most people have cutting boards larger than the counter space. Once, a family member visited, and asked where the rest of the apartment was. Somehow they made their tiny home work.</p>
                                <p class="text-center margin-bottom-30 our-story-el">This was also the year that they took their first Disney trip as a couple. It was magical. The incredible production in the parks made Joe “ooh” and “ahh,” and reminded Jes of the nostalgia of childhood. A perfect dinner at Victoria and Albert’s beautiful tasting menu with fine wines for Joe and water tasting for Jes (yes, it's a thing.)</p>

                                <p class="text-center margin-bottom-30 our-story-el">Even in their tiny home, Jes and Joe spent another year growing and learning together. At every turn, the two were still amazed that, even after several years together, there was so much more to learn about the other.</p>

                                <p class="text-center margin-bottom-30 our-story-el">At some point amidst all of these adventures, they realized that they wanted it all to keep happening, forever. And on one hot day in July, the conversation shifted to marriage. They agreed that a small city hall wedding would be a clever idea.<p/> 
                                <p class="text-center margin-bottom-30 our-story-el">Then a friend suggested they incorporate their love of Disney into their wedding plans. Joe was immediately sold on the idea. In typical Jes fashion, she did far more than the necessary research, and came to the same conclusion. </p>

We head south to Walt Disney World to make it official at the end of March. The party will be small, but never fear; we'll be visiting all our loved ones during the rest of the year.</p>
